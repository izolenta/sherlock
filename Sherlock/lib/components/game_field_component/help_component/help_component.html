    &laquo;...Sherlock is a computerized version of logic puzzles, where you're presented with a series of clues that help you to determine the exact locations of all of the images on the playing board. Each row of the playing board contains images of the same type (faces, houses, numbers, fruit, street signs, letters, etc). The computer scrambles the locations of the items in each row (without showing you their locations) and then presents to you a set of graphical clues that describe the positional relationships of different images. You use the clues to deduce where things can't be (and where they HAVE to be) until you know where all of the images are located.&raquo; <nobr>&copy; <a href="http://www.kaser.com/sherwin.html">Everett Kaiser</a></nobr>

    This game has been created under the inspiration of the old-school Sherlock game, originally written by Everett Kaiser more than 20 years ago.
